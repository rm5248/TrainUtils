1. PowerCab sends out a ping every ~5 MS
2. 900ms does not seem to be a hard and fast rule.
3. DelayUs seems to be ~double the time specified.  Don't use it.
4. The PowerCab looks like it draws .06A on boot, and .09A when being used as a PowerCab.
   Not sure which is more representative.
5. Voltage Regulator = MC7805CT
6. For the voltage regulator, 9v in will give us 5v out
7. The cab bus spec states that the first byte is the key press information,
   and that the second byte is the speed - this is wrong.  It is actually reversed.
   (probably an endianess thing)
